# Lecture 4: Graph as Matrix
Treating a graph as a matrix allows us to:
- Determine node importance via random walk (PageRank)
- Obtain node embeddings via matrix factorization (MF)
- View other node embeddings (e.g. Node2Vec) as MF
- Random walk, matrix factorization and node embeddings are closely related!

## Lecture 4.1: PageRank
Webs : directed graph

all web pages are not equally "important"

We will cover the following Link Analysis approaches to compute the importance of nodes in a graph:
- PageRank
- Personalized PageRank (PPR)
- Random Walk with Restarts

Idea: Links as votes
- Page is more important if it has more links - In-coming links? Out-going links?
- Think of in-links as votes:
  - www.stanford.edu has 23,400 in-links
  - thispersondoesnotexist.com has 1 in-link
- Are all in-links equal?
  - Links from important pages count more
  - "Recursive question!

"A "vote" from an important page is worth more:
- Each link's vote is proportional to the importance of its source page
- If page $i$ with importance $r_i$ has $d_i$ out-links, each link gets $r_i / d_i$ votes
- Page $j^{\prime}$ s own importance $r_j$ is the sum of the votes on its inlinks

A page is important if it is pointed to by other important pages
- Define "rank" $r_j$ for node $j$
$$
r_j=\sum_{i \rightarrow j} \frac{r_i}{d_i}
$$
$d_i \ldots$ out-degree of node $i$

but DONOT use GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION?!
